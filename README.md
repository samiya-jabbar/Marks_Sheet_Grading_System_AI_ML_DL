# Marks_Sheet_Grading_System_AI_ML_DL

## multiclass, single label classification

A basic Artificial Intelligence project that uses Deep learning and Machine learning algorithms.
You just need to provide marks of all 5 subjects and this model will predict your grade (A+,B,C etc)

##Find Grades(Rules) with Deep Learning- Neural Networks :
* optimizer: SGD with learning rat of 0.002
* activation function relu and softmax
* epochs : 20 only
* Achieved Accuracy of model : 70% 

##Find Grades(Rules) with Machine Learning- Decision Tree :
* using sklearn
* Achieved Accuracy : 100%
